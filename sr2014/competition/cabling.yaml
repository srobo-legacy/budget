  Cabling hire for the competition.

  Cabling hire for SR2012 (the year before last) was ~£300.  This
  event is 2.25 times larger (54 versus 24 teams) than SR2012.
  Assuming a linear scaling with number of teams, this leads to £675.

  This includes power, audio cabling, a radio mic, and a mixing desk.

  Messrs Bennellick and Welton have pledged their expertise and time
  to perform the installation of this.

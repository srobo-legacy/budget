summary: Insurance against injury at the competition

cost: 182

description: >-
  Last year (SR2013), we paid Event Insurance Services Ltd. Â£152 for
  public liability insurance for an event with up to 500 people at it.
  We actually had about 320 people attend, as this was the number of
  wristbands we used.  We can expect SR2014 to involve about 1.5 times
  as many people, which would be 480.  So it would be sensible to get
  insurance for 600 people.

  If we guess that the insurance company linearly scales (which it
  won't, and will hopefully be better than linear), then this leads to
  the price above for an event with 600 people.

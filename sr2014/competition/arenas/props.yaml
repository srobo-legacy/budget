summary: Props for the arena

cost: 150 * 2

description: >-
  The game will almost certainly involve some kind of props.

  We don't know what they are yet.  We spent £250 in SR2012, and £0 in
  SR2013.  Evidently this is quite variable.  £150 seems like a
  reasonable amount per arena, so that's what this spend is based on.

consumable: true

  Scaff hire and transport.

  Twice as much scaff as last year for two arenas.  Price is double
  the cost of last year's scaff plus £25 delivery each way, all
  rounded up to £550.

  SR2013's delivery situation was complex because Harsco's depo had
  moved and they were still reconfiguring themselves.  At the time,
  they had no delivery drivers, and so this resulted in a
  significantly more expensive delivery charge.

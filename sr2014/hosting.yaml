  Hosting of the Student Robotics website with linode.com for one year.
  We're charged at $40/month (their branding appears to changes fairly often)
  so this is based on a combination of the numbers provided by Jemery in
  #2486 combined with some fudge to allow for currency conversions.

  While typical SR years run competition to competition, this line follows
  the precedent of the one in sr2013 and actually covers the period from
  November 2013 for a year.

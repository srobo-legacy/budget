  USB motor board cases.

  All of our motor boards are being replaced with USB motor boards for
  SR2014.

  As these boards don't exist yet it's very hard to know how much cases will
  cost. The estimate is based on the cost of the motor, jointio and servo
  board cases from the last batch created.

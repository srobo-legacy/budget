  USB motor board assembly.

  All of our motor boards are being replaced with USB motor boards for
  SR2014.

  See https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/Kits/2011 for cost. Based on
  what we paid Garner Osborne for the v2 motor boards last year. I expect them
  to be significantly smaller so the cost should be less.

  sr2014_total_kits is 79, we're getting 80 kits worth made for no other
  reason than it's a nicer number.

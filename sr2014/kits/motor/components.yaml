summary: Components for the USB motor boards

cost: (25.00 * 2 * sr2014_total_kits) + 419 + 133.85

  USB motor board assembly.

  All of our motor boards are being replaced with USB motor boards for
  SR2014.

  Based on the cost of the components for the v2 boards plus a little bit due
  to using a monolithic H-bridge IC which might work out slightly more
  expensive. See https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/Kits/2011.

  The extra £419 is due to us having to order more H-bridge ICs that we required.
  And a final £133.85 due to miscellaneous overspends.

  We're replacing all of our batteries, since the old ones weren't
  that great.

  Price is based on the order that's currently in progress at the time
  of writing (£997.75 for the items), combined with actual shipping
  fees (turned out at £350.08 for these, but this price is spread out
  over several budget lines), then 20% VAT and the predicted 2.7%
  customs duty.

  Assembly of the new power boards (tentatively named the "genuine
  power board").

  This new power board will be smaller and have less on it.  I expect
  it will be more than the SR13.F motor board (£40 each), and less
  than the SR13.F power board in cost (£110 each).  £60 seems like a
  reasonablly safe number to pick out of the air.

description: >-
  For the second year, we're going to host the competition somewhere far
  from all our branches. In order to ensure that the competition is a
  success we need as many blueshirts as we can get, and don't want them
  worrying about the cost of travel/accommodation.

  £2.5k is a guess based on a suggestion that it would have cost about
  £1.2k for travellodge for those that needed it for SR2014, and then dialed
  up to also include travel costs and more mentors.

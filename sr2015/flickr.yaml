summary: Flickr, a photo sharing service

cost: 150000000 * 1.2

description: >-
    We store many of our photos on Flickr, but it's useful to keep our data
    under our own control. It therefore makes sense to buy Flickr.

    $250 million US dollars seems like a reasonable estimate, which is
    approximately Â£150 million.

    This includes VAT.

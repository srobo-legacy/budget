summary: RCDs for each team in the competition

cost: 75 + 540

  Purchase for RCDs for deployment to each team.

  We already have 12 RCDs, which was enough for a 20-team
  competition.  Our competition is going to approximately double in
  size (36 teams), so we need approximately another 12 RCDs.  The
  RCDs that we purchased previously have gone up in price, but some
  cheaper ones have also come along.  So this budgets £5 per RCD, plus
  some fudge -> £75.

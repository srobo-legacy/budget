summary: Power and audio equipment for the competition

cost: 75 + 540

description: >-
  Both the hire of cabling, and purchase of RCDs for deployment
  amongst said cabling.

  We already have 12 RCDs, which was enough for a 20-team
  competition.  Our competition is going to approximately double in
  size (36 teams), so we need approximately another 12 RCDs.  The
  RCDs that we purchased previously have gone up in price, but some
  cheaper ones have also come along.  So this budgets £5 per RCD, plus
  some fudge -> £75.

  Since the competition's bigger, it requires more cable than last
  year as well.  So the cable hire will go up as well.  We spent ~£300
  on cable hire last year, and the event has 1.8 times as many teams.
  So assuming a linear scaling, it's £540.  That includes power and
  audio cabling, a radio mic, and a mixing desk etc.

  Last year we spent £636.11 on shipping, having spent £1494 in the
  previous year.  We are getting better at not having to ship things
  at ultra high speed, so 

  Furthermore, it is likely that we will ask teams to arrange for
  their kit to be couriered to them, so we will not need to pay for it.

  This fund is for the emergency shipping of things to and from teams.
